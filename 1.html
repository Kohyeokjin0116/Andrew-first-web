<h2>My life in China and my favorite things</h2>
My name is Andrew. Korean name is 고혁진. I am a <strong>Korean</strong> 
boy living in <u>Yantai, China</u>.
<br><br>I came to China when I was in Grade 3. 
Now I am a grade 10, IGCSE 1 student in YWIES Yantai.
<P>My favorite subject in school is math and computer science. 
They are both bit hard, but they are very interesting and fun to learn.</P>
<p style="margin-top:40px;">My favorite sport in football. 
<a href="https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en" target="_blank" 
title="FIFA official website">Football</a>
is really fun sport. Running to get the ball and score a goal makes football enjoyable.
My favorite sport definitely football but it doesn't mean that I don't 
enjoy playing other sports. I also enjoy to play other sports such as 
badminton, basketball, table tennis, etc.</p>
