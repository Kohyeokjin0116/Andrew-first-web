<h2>My friends</h2><br>
<p> My friends are mainly my classmates. There are more than 25 people 
in my class, G10. Actually, there are 10A and 10B but we have same form tutors
and we have some classes together. Most of my classmates are Chinese but there are
some Korean students like me. The Korean classmates are called Adam and Siwoo.
Some Chinese classmates who are good friends of me are Howard, Neil, Jack, etc..
</p>
<p> My best friends of all is Adam. I was friend with him since kindergarten.
We were friends but as he moved from 구미(my hometown) to 파주(another city in Korea)
and I moved from Korea to Yantai, China. We didn't communicate with each other frequently
and we almost couldn't meet each other because of far distance and covid-19.
However, suprising fact was that he and his family also came to Yantai.
Therefore, we could meet again and become best friends.
</p>
<p>with my friend, Adam and his older brother, Edward and June from G11,
I often play games, especially League of Legends (LOL). Playing games with
them is extremely fun and exciting.
